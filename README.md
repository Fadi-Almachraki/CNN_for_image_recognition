# CNN_for_image_recognition
## Python/Keras implementation of various CNN architectures to classify dog breeds

This project will work to develop an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app. 
At the end of this project, the code will accept any user-supplied image as input. 

* If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed 
* If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling. 

In this real-world setting, we will need to piece together a series of models to perform different tasks. 
for instance, the algorithm that detects humans in an image will be different from the CNN that infers dog breed. 
There are many points of possible failure, and no perfect algorithm exists. 
The imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!

## The Road Ahead
* Step 0: Import Datasets
* Step 1: Detect Humans
* Step 2: Detect Dogs
* Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
* Step 4: Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
* Step 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
* Step 6: Write a new Algorithm
* Step 7: Testing the Algorithm
